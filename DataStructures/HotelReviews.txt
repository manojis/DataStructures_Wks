Amazing service at the service department! Especially from (DN). She took care of our cars and provided 5 star service at every step!

It could not have been more seamless and made the process very pleasant. Their attention to detail and my satisfaction was unparalleled- going above and beyond in every aspect!

Smooth transaction and very helpful staff made my first car buying experience easy. (DN) and the crew have given me their full attention to all my car needs. Thanks again for the great help!

This was the easiest dealership I have worked with. I was in and out in 2 hours. (DN) was efficient but also made sure that everything was covered at the best price in town. I recommended anyone to go see (DN)

DN) helped us find the perfect car for us! He took the time to listen to our needs and budget, and had several quick recommendations. We loved being able to look at it and test drive it without him hovering, and the whole experience took less than 2 hours on a Saturday! Our experience at (CD) was so much better, easier, and faster than at a major dealership, and we will definitely go back the next time we need a used car.

Outstanding service! Very happy with the purchase of my car. I have purchased a few vehicles from here over the years and they have all been reliable. (DN) was helpful and answered my questions!

The buyer fully inspected the vehicle. Pictures were uploaded and I recieved an offer within 30 minutes which I accepted. Smooth and fair transaction.
